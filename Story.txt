The clever monkey and the two cats

Once, there were two cats who were really good friends. Their names were Lucy and Mia. One day
both of them were searching for food together. They came across a cold roti lying on the street. They 
both rushed to grab it as soon as they saw it. However, Lucy was quicker and grabbed the roti before
Mia could. This made Mia angry. She told her friend that the roti belonged to her as she had seen it 
first. Lucy denied and said that it didn't matter now because she grabbed the roti first. They both 
started arguing over the roti. 
Meanwhile a monkey was observing them fight from a tree. He thought of something and approached
the fighting cats. Firstly, he calmed them down. Then he told them that he had a solution to their fight.
He suggested that he would tear the roti equally in half for them. The cats agreed and handed him the
roti. The monkey took the roti tore into two pieces. One bigger than the other. He apoligized for doing
so and told the cats that he would eat a bit from the larger piece to make it equal. The cats agreed.
So the monkey took a bite from the larger piece of roti. But the bite was too big and made the 
previously larger piece into smaller one. The monkey apoligized and said that he would now take a piece
from the larger part. This kept continuing until the whole roti was eaten. The cats were furious.
They started chasing the monkey but the monkey was took quick and climbed up a tree. The cats 
knowing that the couldn't do anything else returned home hungry.
